# Symbols and Tags
*Symbols* are like *Table of Contents* for a file.

- `Markdown` uses headings `# Heading`
- `JSON` uses Dictionaries `"object": {`
- `YAML` uses Dictionaries `object: `
- `ini` `cfg` use headings `[heading]`

Symbols can have *Tags*. Tags are added with comments.

- `Markdown` uses `<!-- #tag1 #tag2 -->`
- `JSON` uses `"#": "#tag1 #tag2"`
- `YAML` uses `# #tag1 #tag2` or `"#": "#tag1 #tag2"`
- `ini` `cfg` uses `; #tag1 #tag2`

Symbols are per file, tags are shared across files.

When a file is opened with tags, they show up in bottom right *Tag Container*.

Click them to toggle on and off.\
This will then highlight *Files* and *Symbols* that have that tag.
